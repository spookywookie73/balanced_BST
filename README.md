# balanced_BST
This is my Ruby Balanced Binary Search Tree project for The Odin Project.

I spent alot of time doing this project to make sure I understood everything that
the code was doing.
I thought it was finished, but when I started to run the tests, I noticed that
after I inserted some numbers, the balanced? method would delete 5 of them.
I spent more time trying to figure out the problem but couldn't, so this is the 
code I have submitted.
